# CoachCollab

### Problem
-------------
I used to take private tennis lessons frequently in the past, and used to pay the coach in cash after every five lessons. But then, I started wondering about a society where people coach students for free of cost during their free time to promote education and learning in places of greater need. While I cannot influence people's minds to offer free lessons, what I can and did do was create a platform where this idea could be advanced to the next stage. So, I created a mobile app called CoachCollab. 

### Solution
-----------
The overall idea of the app was to have a two type login system - as a student or as a teacher. Then, the user would have to setup their preferences: subjects that they are interested in, date, time, and location of their lesson. So now, the student would get access to the teachers available and view their preferences in the app to request them for a lesson. Then the teachers will get those requests on their dashboard to be accepted or declined. If accepted, that event will be added to that student's schedule. Then, once their lesson is over, both of them get the ability to rate the eachother so that future teachers and students can have an idea of how good they are.
